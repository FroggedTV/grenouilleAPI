In this case, the user needs to have the appropriate user rights to use the endpoint.</p>\n<h2>Authentication</h2>\n<p>User authentication module. User logs with steam, and is redirected to the website with a refresh token valid for 60 days. The refresh token is then used to get a auth token, valid for 1 hour.
